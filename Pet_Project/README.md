# Neural Network Pet Project

## Define a ML problem and propose a solution
_Timeline: by 23rd Oct_

* Articulate your problem
- Start a chat with Tototatutu on Discord, but in reality it’s an AI ("small" turing test)

* See if any labeled data exists
- Discord chat in CSV format

* Design your data for the model
- CSV format with X columns
- Variables: 

* Determine where data comes from

* Determine easily obtained inputs

* Determine quantifiable outputs
